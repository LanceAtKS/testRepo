This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
summary(cars)
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
lm1 <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
abline(lm1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
